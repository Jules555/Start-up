# Start-up
I  will be uploading here html and php files

### it's been a while without uploading anything here but it was because i was doing my internship for almost 9 months so i was somehow busy but i'm back now. i'm gonna be active from now.

This Repository has different files and some of them are for 1 project 
i will help to mention which ones are together


## onlinecalculator.html and Results.php these files are for a simple online calculator 
where in the first file(onlinecalculator.html)there are html codes which gives the user where to write inputs and select an operator with input and the second file(Results.php) gets the iut from the user and the operates them.
